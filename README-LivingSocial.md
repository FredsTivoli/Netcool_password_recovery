I was inspired to write *recover_netcool_passwd.pl* in response to there not being a process for recovering IBM Tivoli Netcool user passwords. Netcool is an enterprise level fault management tool used primarily by large companies to actively monitor and resolve network fault and performance issues. Finding that there was a pattern in the encrypted passwords used by the application, I quickly wrote a script that could recover any length alphanumeric password. I am proud of the tool since it will save network management systems (NMS) administratorâ€™s potentially large amounts of time in recovering passwords that would require application reinstalls and/or significant reconfiguration.

Sincerely,
Rutger Thomschutz
