# Objective: Perl application to recover Netcool ObjectServer password via
#        systematic brute force.
# Usage: When prompted, enter the encrypted Netcool user password to be
#        recovered.
# Logic: 1. Create array of all letters in alphabet and numbers 0-9 
#        2. Parse the password into blocks of two characters and store in array 
#        3. Traverse the array, encrypting one character at a time
#        4. Compare encrypted character to encrypted password
#        5. If the encrypted character matches the encrypted password, then store
#        and move on to next character unless then end of the encrypted password
#        has been met.
# Dependencies: IBM Tivoli Netcool installed on local system where script is run.
